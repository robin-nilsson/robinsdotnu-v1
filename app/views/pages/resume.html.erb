			<div class="item">
				<p>I am a social, analytical and knowledge-hungry team player. As a problem solver by heart, I see possibilities and solutions where others see obstacles. I think the journey is more important than the destination, because it gives me valuable lessons on how to be a better developer for my next project. My biggest challenge is time estimation and time management, both professionally and as a programming hobbyist. I always try to stay up to date on the newest and hottest technologies out there, not because I have to (I do!) - but because I'm very passionate about what I do for a living!</p>
